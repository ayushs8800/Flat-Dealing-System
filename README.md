# Flat-Dealing-System
This project is designed to save the data of all those customers
who hire , lease or buy any kind of flats which will reduce
manual work and help the dealer to save the records efficiently.
This project is aimed at developing a flat dealing software. We
are managing the records of buyers by the help of data
structures. We are using LINKED LISTS so that the same type of
flats are grouped together. We have designed the software like that the dealer
gets the details of all buyers sorted in whichever condition he
may require , for eg. – Buyers who want 2 bhk flat , or buyers
who want a flat at a specific location , etc… We have designed
various functions in this software that do specific tasks like we
are able to edit a record if a buyer changes his mind for buying
another type of another type of flat and we are also able to
delete a record if in case dealing with a certain buyer is cancelled.
